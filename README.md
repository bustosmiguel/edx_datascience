Hello, 

First: I couldn't upload others files in github, because 25MB itÂ´s the limit file, but here you can find the others files: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QP2RatOJmho6f88tbIdATvNf4TeOsqCX?usp=sharing

And you can see a .png that show you the "RMSE" and the "file list".

Third: In case that you use windows and need to increase R memory, you can do it with this code memory.limit(size = 1.7e+13)

Best regards,

Miguel Bustos
