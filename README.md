Hello, 

First: I couldn't upload two files in github, because 25MB itÂ´s the limit file, but here you can find these: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QP2RatOJmho6f88tbIdATvNf4TeOsqCX?usp=sharing

Second: In case that you use windows and need to increase R memory, you can do it with this code memory.limit(size = 1.7e+13)

Best regards,

Miguel Bustos
